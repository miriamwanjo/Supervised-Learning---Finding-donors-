# Supervised-Learning---Finding-donors-
> Employing supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. 
> Then use the best algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. 

### Project outline

1. Exploring and preprocessing data
2. Creating a training and predicting pipeline
3. Model evaluation - initializing 3 supervised learning models;
> > 1. RandomForest Classifier
> > 2. AdaBoost Classifier
> > 3. Logistic Regression
4. Choosing the best model and Model tuning
5. feature importance
